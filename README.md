# ZVS loss measurement controller

Controller for a full bridge converter topology. One of the transistors in the converter is the DUT. Converter is operated so that the DUT is turned-on with full ZVS and turned-on at controlled current level. Based on a TMDSCNCD280039C control card. 

## Key waveforms

There are two operating modes for the measurement: soft and fard switching. Three DUT swithing events are of interest: 

- ● turn-on
- ○ ZVS turn-on
- × turn-off

### Hard switching

In hard switching mode the turn-on and turn-off are done at the same current level. In order to achieve that an inductor with high inductance value is used.

    ● turn-on                         
    × turn-off          

### Soft switching

In soft switching mode the turn-off is done at the same current level as in the soft switching mode. The turn-on is done at a current level that guarantees a ZVS transition for DUT. In this mode an inductor with low inductance value is used.

## ADC and sampling

All hardware ADC channels are bandwidth limited. The exact frequency needs to be investigated. 

Sampling instance needs to be investigated. Four channels need to be sampled: Vin, Vout, Vclamp and Iout. 

Voltage inputs are isolated with an ACPL-C87B isolation amplifier. Nominal voltage for this amplifier is 2V. Voltage dividers are tuned for nominal voltage magnitudes. Maximum input voltage for the amplifier is 2.46. 

### Input voltage

Voltage divider with an isolation amplifier. R1 = 6×665k. R2 = 10k. Attenuation = 400. 800V ➞ 2.0V. 984V ➞ 2.46V (max).

### Output voltage

Voltage divider with an isolation amplifier. R1 = 6×665k. R2 = 10k. Attenuation = 400. 200V ➞ 0.5V. 920V ➞ 2.3V. 984V ➞ 2.46V (max).

### Clamp current

Current sensor with an isolation amplifier. R1 = 9×665k + 2×10k. R2 = 10k. Attenuation = 601.5. 1200V ➞ 1.995V. 1480V ➞ 2.46V (max). 

### Output current

LES XX-NP current transducer. 0A = 2.5V±0.625·I/Inom. There is a voltage divider on the output of the current transducer. R1 = 3.3k, R2 = 6.8k. Attenuation = 0.6733. ADC should see 1.68±0.4208·I/Inom volts. 

## Protection

Undervoltage and overvoltage setpoints still need to be confirmed in simulations. Output current limits need to be verified experimentally. Ideally there should also be a protection if the controllers are not steady-state within some time period. 

### Input voltage

Nominal voltage Uin = 800V. 

Overvoltage protection set at 105%·Uin = 840V. 

Undervoltage protection set at 90%·Uin = 720V. 

### Output voltage

Nominal voltage range Uout = 200-920V. 

Overvoltage protection set at Uin−10V = 190V. 

Undervoltage protection set at Uout+10V = 930V. 

### Clamp voltage

Nominal volatge Uclamp = Uin·n2/n1 = 1200V.

Overvoltage protection set at 105%·Uin = 1260V. This needs to be tested and controller needs to be tuned not to have an overshoot. 

### Output current

TBD, depends on the hardware limits.
